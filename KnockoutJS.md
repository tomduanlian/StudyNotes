#Knockout JS

* Knockout is usually used to build a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern web UI.

* **_data-bind_** attributes are how Knockout lets you declaratively associate viewmodel properties with DOM elements.
* **_observables_**, a knockout concept - properties that automatically will issue notifications whenever their value changes. __ko.observable__ is used to make the properties of viewmodel observable.
  * Note: After make a property observable and binding it to a input, the dom tree won't update after you finish the input, i.e. tab out from the input.
